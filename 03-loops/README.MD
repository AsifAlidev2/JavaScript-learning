# Loops in JavaScript

## Description
This folder contains examples of loops in JavaScript. Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. This helps in reducing code repetition and automating tasks.

## Topics Covered
1. **For Loop** - Executes code for a fixed number of iterations.
2. **While Loop** - Executes code while a condition is true.
3. **Do-While Loop** - Executes code at least once, then checks the condition.
4. **For...of Loop** - Iterates over iterable objects like arrays.
5. **For...in Loop** - Iterates over properties of an object.

## Code Example
```javascript
// Example of For Loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
